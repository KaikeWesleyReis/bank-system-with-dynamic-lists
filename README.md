# Bank System based on Threatened Lists in C

**Overview**: This code was created to improve my knowledge in **data structure**, **pointers** and **code encapsulation**. The architecture for the code is examplify by the fluxogram bellow.

In words, there is a **AGENCY LIST** where each agency has a **CLIENT LIST** where each client could have two types of **ACCOUNT** and each account could have a **OPERATION LIST** made by the user like withdrawal, extract and transfer. All this is based on dynamic list, meaning that is possible to delete a client or a agency and keep the list functional.

## HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
- This code is based on a *txt file* input. Use **ex.txt** as example to understand more the implementation, is pretty simple.
- For a first execute, run the *.exe* file called **bankProgram** available in this repository and then write *ex.txt*

## SOME NOTES
- First I developed this code using *Dev-C++* and after using *VS Code*. So I tried to keep this code more generic as possible.
- This code was initially created in portuguese-br language, but I manage to change the commentaries to english.
- the **ex.txt** when you run show some errors. This NORMAL, it was developed to analyzed how the code response to problems situations.
